                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>My 7-year-old was very excited to get this set for his birthday.
                     For the price, I'm very happy with how the helicopter turned out,
                      as well as the fact that it came with a cage, saber-toothed tiger and atv as well.
                       All 4 blades turn at the same time! He loves it!</p>
                       <br>
                       <p>This set has an arctic helicopter/plane vehicle with 4 rotors and landing skis.
                            The set has 2 characters/minifigures, a pilot and a driver of the 4-wheeler vehicle.
                             There's also a neat icy cave made with clear blue and a few white Lego pieces to make
                              the snow and ice effect more realistic! Trapped inside is an extinct saber-tooth tiger! RAWRRR!
